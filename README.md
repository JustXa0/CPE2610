# CPE2610

This repository contains each of my implementations for assigned labs in MSOE's CPE2610, Embedded Systems.
Each lab was built using the STMCubeIDE found [at this link](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html), with the STM32F411 board selected per project.
Provided in each lab folder is the header and source files as well as the respective lab handout.Lab 9 was a culmination of each previous project as well as our own component to build an original device. A README file within this folder provides more information about my project, a **museum alarm system**.

## Intentions & Cheating

This repository isn't designed or created with the intent as a cheating source or to provide quick solutions to the complex problems associated with embedded programming. Instead, this repository was created with the intention of providing evidence of my skill set as well as insight into my thought process.

If any professors or those working within the education sector find students are utilizing this repository for means other than inspiration on unique personal projects, please [reach out to me](mailto:james.prendiville05@gmail.com) to find a solution.
