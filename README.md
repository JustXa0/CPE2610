# CPE2610

This repository contains each of my implementations for assigned labs in MSOE's CPE2610, Embedded Systems.
Each lab was built using the STMCubeIDE found [at this link](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html), with the STM32F411 board selected per project.

## Intentions & Cheating

This repository isn't designed or created with the intent as a cheating source or to provide quick solutions to the complex problems associated with embedded programming. Instead, this repository was created with the intention of providing evidence of my skill set as well as insight into my thought process.

If any professors or those working within the education sector find students are utilizing this repository for means other than inspiration on unique personal projects, please [reach out to me](mailto:james.prendiville05@gmail.com) to find a solution.
